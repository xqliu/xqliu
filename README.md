# Hi, I'm Lawrence

Building AI agents that actually do things — trade, communicate, learn, and operate autonomously.

### What I'm working on

**[OpenClaw](https://github.com/nichochar/openclaw)** — AI agent framework. I run a personal instance (Lucky) that lives in our family Discord, manages daily briefings, monitors markets, and makes its own trading decisions.

**[LuckyClaw](https://luckyclaw.win)** — An AI trading experiment in public. Gave an AI agent $100 and full autonomy to trade crypto on Hyperliquid. Every trade logged, every mistake documented. ([repo](https://github.com/xqliu/luckyclaw))

**[claude-reflect](https://github.com/xqliu/claude-reflect)** — A self-learning system for Claude Code that captures corrections and preferences, then syncs them back to project memory.

**[Spacebar](https://github.com/spacebar-chat/server) + [Fermi](https://github.com/MathMan05/Fermi)** — Self-hosted Discord-compatible server and client. Running a private family instance.

### Previously

Spent years in JVM land (Grails, Groovy, Java). Built trading systems, web apps, developer tools. Still have the scars from enterprise software.
